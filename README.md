# Pythia Cook-off 2025

[![nightly-build](https://github.com/ProjectPythia/pythia-cookoff-2025/actions/workflows/nightly-build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ProjectPythia/pythia-cookoff-2025/actions/workflows/nightly-build.yaml)


## Join Project Pythia August 5-8 2025 
In-person in Boulder, CO at the [NCAR Mesa Lab](https://scied.ucar.edu/visit).

**Registration will open mid-May and close July 20th.**

## What is it?

_Take a look at some [Cookbooks that got made at the 2024 Cook-off](https://projectpythia.org/posts/new-cookbooks.html) event!_

Project Pythia continues offering its annual _Cook-off_ hackathon for creating and maintaining Pythia Cookbooks. [Pythia Cookbooks](https://cookbooks.projectpythia.org) are crowd-sourced collections of domain-specific tutorials and exemplar workflows, building upon our [Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org) tutorials. Cookbooks are supported by a rich GitHub-based infrastructure enabling collaborative authoring and automated health-checking to ensure reproducibility.

Participants in the Cook-off will develop their skills in contributing code and non-code to open source projects, demonstrating open science practices, and communicating and collaborating with other professionals. By doing so, they will grow the collection of accessible, reusable, and reproducible Cookbooks. This is a space for scientists, educators, and developers to bring their ideas, existing code, or rough notebooks and collaborate on turning them into community Cookbooks.


## Who is this for?

You!
Hackathon may be a scary word, but this event is for students, scientists, educators, engineers, hobbyists, professionals, and more across a spectrum of expertise and ability.
Familiarity with Python, git and GitHub, and Jupyter will help you best collaborate with others and best build your skills during the brief Hackathon period.
Check out [Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org) for a crash course in these topics.
We also encourage non-code participation through the creation of narrative text, images or GIFs, and even produced videos to support Cookbook content.

Pythia is committed to building a community for geoscientists to come together and share open source solutions. We hope that our platform can represent and support the many voices working together to solve a global challenge.
