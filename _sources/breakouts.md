# Breakout Groups

Attendees of this year's hackathon will kick off the event by establishing small groups of contributors centered around Cookbook topics and areas of expertise.
Participants are not required to contribute to only one topic or group throughout the event, but your primary group will serve as a point of consistency and community and a hub of communication you can rely on throughout the event.
If you have new ideas, existing Cookbook content, or a desire to lead and organize one of these small groups, please follow the steps to indicate this during your registration.
Project Pythia will prepare breakout leaders ahead of the event by providing support with computing resources and idea shaping.
This event can only function with the support of breakout leaders!
Please reach out to [projectpythia@ucar.edu](mailto:projectpythia@ucar.edu) if you have any additional questions!
